This place is equipped with lights yet they only sell buckets of balls until 730.  It is still light out.  Finally lets you have the pit to hit into.  When I arrived I wasn't sure if this was a driving range or an excavation site for a mastodon or a strip mining operation.  There is no grass on the range. Just mud.

Initial impression was great, as the decor is very contemporary and the restaurant is clean.  \\nThe selection of lunch specials wasn't as extensive as other spots in town, but as this was my first visit I wanted to try a range of the old standbys anyway.  Ordered Pork Larb, Chicken Pad Thai, and Chicken Red Curry...with all dishes being a 3 or 4 on their 1 - 5 spice scale as my coworker doesn't go super spicy.\\nPrior to the food being served, waiter brought out a small sample of Egg Drop Soup with Crispy Noodles, which was a nice touch.\\nPork Larb was served first.  Nothing particularly remarkable.  I usually shy away from Larbs that incorporate mint leaves, but this Larb used just enough to provide some complexity without being overpowering.  Had the pork not been overdone, I think this would be a pretty solid Larb.\\nThe Pad Thai and Red Curry came after a short wait, with the Curry being accompanied by a very modest portion of rice.  The Pad Thai was probably the highlight of the meal...good flavor and heavy on the scallions, although it certainly wasn't winning any awards.  The Red Curry was completely uninspired.  It had a nice, rich color and a good amount of both meat and vegetables, albeit a little heavy on the bamboo, but once it got in the mouth the flavor was flat and quite salty and there was no noticeable spice in the level 4.\\nI probably would not stop here for a quick lunch as service was attentive, but the kitchen a little more leisurely.  However, I will probably stop here again for dinner to try some other dishes.  For example, a large bowl of soup was served to a neighboring table and it looked quite good.

The food on the buffet was excellent.  The buffet offered options of turkey, ham, prime rib, and lamb.   There was also an area where you can order omelets or pancakes.   Tons of food with very good quality.    On the other hand; the service was unbelievably poor.    We had to virtually send up a solar flare in the sky to get the server to stop and give us refills on water or champagne.    Our server Steve didn't have that many tables either and it was not crowded at the 3:30 PM seating in the formal dining room.    I did notice our server had a different level of attentiveness for our table in comparison to his others.   It was blantently obvious at one point he passed by our table and we both had dirty plates and I motioned for assistance he responded I'll be there in a sec; but a sec was minutes later.  Instead he utilized his time to fill up water glasses at adjacent tables marginally empty and chat with guest who had already eaten.   Perhaps his lackluster performance as a server hinged on the fact that gratuity was already included.  If this is the case he didn't earn one dime of it.  $189.45 for two people is a reasonable price for a Thanksgiving brunch if service is at least average.  This was not the case here and I admonish management for not monitoring poor performance of their servers.  The mansion is immaculate and I may come back for a random  tour and lunch; but for holiday buffet I will err on the side of caution because you never know what server you're going to get here.
